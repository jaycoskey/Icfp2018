2018 ICFP Programming Competition: 3D printing using nanobots in parallel

* Day 1: Created much of the needed supporting infrastructure (commands, model, nanobot code, etc.).
* Day 2: Code clean-up. Added some checks. Found that reading & writing the default trace files didn't result in files identical to the original. Not sure why the default trace files start with 0x34. Did not proceed to trace generation.
